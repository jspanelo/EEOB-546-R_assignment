# R_assignment
EEOB546 - R assignment 

Files


`R_assignment_juan.Rmd` Main file, in md format


`script analysis.R`     Simlar to main file, but in R script. I added because I have some issues with Rmd in my laptop, 
                                   so then you can run this one in the case something goes wrong 



`functions_R_assignment.R` Function used for filtering and dividing files into 40 different files



`R_assign.Rdata` R workspace. I assume it has all the intermediate files loaded.



`R_assignment.RProj` Entire R-Project


`.Rhistory` to ignore


`fang_et_al_genotypes.txt` Genotypes file


`snp_position.txt` SNPs positions file

Folders


`/Output` output files and plots


`/.RProj.user` ignore it

Plots and files are allocated in the output folder
Answers for the first section are included in the code. If for any reason `R_assignment_juan.Rmd` doesn't work properly, `script analysis.R` 
has the same information.

For the second section, the `R_assignment_juan.Rmd` only includes the merging section. For details in how
the separation into different files was done, that is detailed in `script analysis.R`

Both `SNP_*.jpg` belogns to the first assginment of the last section


Both `Proportion_by_*.jpg` belongs to the second assginment of the last section


`own_plot.jpg` is the plot generated by my own
